            umbrella. Water stands on roads and they become muddy and slippery. Those who have offices and other
            businesses go out with umbrellas overhead. in hand and clothes folded up to the knees. Sometimes they slip
            and fall on the mud. A rainy day is a curse for a poor man. He can’t go out for his daily works. He has to
            sit under his leaky roof. Most of the students can not go to school. Only a few can go to school but they
            get wet. The cattle keep standing in their sheds and bellow for fodder. A rainy day is amusing for the rich.

            rainfall. The entire sky is overcast A with a cloud. The atmosphere is dull and gloomy. Because of incessant
            rain, many places go underwater and life loses movement. Ponds overflow and yards and roads become muddy and
            slippery. It becomes almost impossible to walk. Then communication becomes difficult. Especially the
            transportation system is disrupted in the rural areas. If anyone feels it essential to go out, he has to
            carry an umbrella to keep over his head. But there are many things that people enjoy on a rainy day. As the

            indoor games. Often a family sits together and gossip for long and enjoy various fast food including “Muri”,
            Chanachur” etc. Many like to play cards. Children especially girls like to play carom in cheers and
            excitements. Sometimes children, especially boys play football in the rainwater in the nearby fields which
            is much exciting to them. On a rainy day, the most common dish that people like most is a hotchpotch. It
            becomes more delicious if there is any Hilsa fish. People often arrange this dish especially if the rainfall
            continues more than one day. However, there are some demerits on a rainy day. <a href="https://amazon.com"
